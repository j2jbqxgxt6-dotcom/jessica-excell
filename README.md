# Minimal Portfolio (three pages)

What this is
- A minimal static site with:
  - index.html — big name + two options
  - graphic-design.html — simple gallery
  - illustration.html — simple gallery
  - styles.css — site styling (shared)

How to customize
- Replace `your.email@example.com` and the Instagram link in each HTML file with your contact details.
- Replace placeholder images with your own images. Example:
  - Put images in a folder `images/graphic/` or `images/illustration/`
  - Update the `src` attributes in the gallery items, e.g. `images/graphic/graphic1.jpg`.

Hosting
- To host on GitHub Pages: push these files to the root of the `main` branch and enable Pages with "Deploy from: main / root".
- Or drag & drop the site folder into Netlify/Vercel to deploy instantly.
